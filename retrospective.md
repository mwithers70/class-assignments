# Group Retrospective Review

During my time working on the group project I was able to accomplish learning more about my strong attributes and also my challenging attributes in my technical abilities. I was able to help with planning the project. After going over how we wanted our final project to look we assigned task to accomplish. 

Working on some of the coding I definitely stumbled along the way. I believe I started off well with coding our pages add and edit button and features. However, I had difficulty getting some of my code to work. Working in a team allowed me to ask questions and gain further understanding of how to accomplish my task. It was great to work with other members of my team with a variety of expereince. 

I want to improve on my coding and I know that comes with practice. So my outcome is to code, code, code and code somemore.
